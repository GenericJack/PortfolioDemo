            <h3>Life Long Student</h3>

            <p>
                For as much as I learn there is one thing that remains constant: the more I learn, the more I realize how little I know. One would say it is a sisyphean task, but the goal is to learn a little more today than I did yesterday. That's how I remain a lifelong student.
